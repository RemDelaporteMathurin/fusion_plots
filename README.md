# Fusion plots
Plots and figures relevant for a fusion research lecture.

This repository consists of plots I made for a lecture "Fusion Research" (which I give at the University of Stuttgart), for the LATINfusion 2019 event, and for various outreach activities. Most of the plots can be found in some text books but either their formatting style did not agree with mine or they required some updates to account for recent developments.

The source code for producing the plots should contain references to the original publication or data where available. 

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or requests.
